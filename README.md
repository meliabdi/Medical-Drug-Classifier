# ðŸ§¬ Medical Drug Classifier (Therapeutic Class Prediction)

This project explores and classifies a large dataset of medicines based on their **therapeutic class** using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict a drugâ€™s therapeutic class based on its usage and introduction descriptions using natural language processing (NLP).

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is **Medicines Information Dataset (MID)** available on **Kaggle**.  
It contains 192,000+ drug records with the following information:
- Name
- Usage
- Side effects
- Chemical and therapeutic class
- Introduction
- Advice, safety, and administration

ðŸ”— **Download from Kaggle**:  
[Kaggle Dataset â€“ Medicines Information Dataset (MID)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurav9786/medicines-information-dataset)

Once downloaded, place the file `MID.csv` in your working directory or as shown in this project.

## ðŸ“Š Project Phases

### âœ… Phase 1: Data Cleaning & EDA
- Checked missing values and unique classes
- Cleaned text data using regex and whitespace handling
- Combined relevant text columns for NLP

### âœ… Phase 2: Visualisations
- **Bar plot**: Top therapeutic classes
- **Pie chart**: Habit-forming drug ratio
- **Heatmap**: Missing value pattern
- **WordCloud**: Most common usage terms

### âœ… Phase 3: Baseline Classifier
- Built a **Naive Bayes** model using TF-IDF features
- Achieved ~84% accuracy on unmerged classes

### âœ… Phase 4: Final Model
- Merged similar/duplicate therapeutic class names (e.g., *CARDIA â†’ CARDIAC*)
- Filtered rare classes (<50 samples)
- Used **Logistic Regression** + TF-IDF (5000 features)
- Achieved **~97% accuracy** on validation set
- Generated **confusion matrix** and classification report
